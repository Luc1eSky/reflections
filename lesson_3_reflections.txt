When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?



I would want to use a remote repository when I collaborate with others or will work on a project from various computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because sometimes maybe I am working on something that is not yet ready and I don't want it to be displayed on GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are made within your repo, meaning you now have two version of your files in your repo e.g for working on a new
feature. 
Clones are basically copies of a repository.
You can either clone from a copy from a local or online repo on GitHub which creates a local version. 
Forks are used to work  on a repo from someone else without changing it.
